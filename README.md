# Circa-dataset-test
Reproducing some results from the Circa dataset paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03450.pdf

Install approriate libaries according to import headers. 

Run finetune.py to train models, run testing.py to get classification reports.

Can also check out the embedded CSV in my_reports subdir to see my training results.

Trained models are a bit too big, you can download the directory and use directly from this Google Drive:
